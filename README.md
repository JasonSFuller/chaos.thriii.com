I love [Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes](https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/galaxy-of-heroes).
I'm in a guild, Legacy of Chaos, ran by our excellent leader
[Armandz](mailto:frank.armandian@gmail.com).
This is the code base for [our web site](http://chaos.thriii.com/).
Read the [contribution notes](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you'd like to help out, and
[join us on Slack](https://legacyofchaoshome.slack.com).

## Site goals

  * It should be responsive, so it looks good in a mobile browser, as well as
    as a full-blown desktop browser.  SWGOH is a mobile game; most of our users
    will be visiting from the same device.
  * It should use images sparingly.  With high DPI devices today (again, like
    modern phones), plain ol' raster images don't scale well.
