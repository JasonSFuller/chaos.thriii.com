<h1>Chaos</h1>

<hr><h2>Intro</h2>

<p>
  Welcome!  This guide is intended to introduce you to Chaos and lay down a few
  rules.
</p>

<p>
  We only have a few rules, but the most important thing to remember is simply:
  <b>BE NICE!</b>  Everything else can be worked out.  If you accidentally step
  out of bounds, you may be directed here by one of the officers.  Please try
  not to take it personally.  The officers genuinely want to help--and not just
  you, but the guild as a whole.  If you've been given a "warning," don't worry.
  It isn't our intention to ridicule or shame you, but to foster cooperation and
  fairness for everyone.  Our long standing members understand that people
  sometimes make mistakes.  That's why we have a "3 strikes, you're out" policy,
  and not "off with his head."
</p>

<p>
  Hopefully, this guide will help clarify things for you, but if you have
  questions, please feel free to ask on the guild chat... or better yet, ask in
  Slack.  Don't be shy!  Others probably have the same questions as you, so
  don't be surprised if your questions (and answers) show up here.
</p>



<hr><h2>The rules</h2>

<h3>Be nice</h3>

<p>
  This is <i>absolutely</i> rule number one, and I cannot emphasize this enough:
  <b>don't be an asshole!</b>  Nothing will get you shutdown faster than being a
  jerk.
</p>

<p>
  And don't be a kiss ass either!  You don't have to agree with everyone.  We
  love <i>and encourage</i> discussion, but...
  <ol>
    <li>show common courtesy</li>
    <li>stay calm</li>
    <li>address ideas, not people, <i>i.e.</i> no personal insults</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h3>3 strikes and you're out</h3>

<p>
  If you break the rules, you'll be given 2 warnings.  On your 3rd offense,
  you'll be kicked out of the guild.
</p>



<hr><h2>FAQ</h2>

<p>
  <div><b>Why is Kung Fu Grip so <i>very</i> stupid?</b></div>
  <div>
    Because he loves lead paint chips and long walks on the beach with your mom.
  </div>
</p>
<p>
  <div><b>How do I join Slack?</b></div>
  <div>
    Before you begin, download the app.  Slack has clients for both iOS and
    Android, plus Windows/Mac/Linux clients for a computer.  There's even a web
    client if you'd rather not install anything, though we recommend putting it
    on the same device you play SWGOH.
  </div>
  <div>
    The easiest way to join is via invite. Simply post your email using the
    in-game guild chat and ask for a Slack invite.
  </div>
  <div>
    The team URL is <a href="https://legacyofchaoshome.slack.com">legacyofchaoshome.slack.com</a>.
  </div>
</p>



<hr>
<p class="small">
  Something wrong?  Typo?  Suggestions?  Send a message to <b>Kung Fu Grip</b>.
  <a href="https://legacyofchaoshome.slack.com">Slack</a> or
  <a href="mailto:JasonSFuller@gmail.com.">email</a> is the best way to reach
  me, since messages in the guild chat usually roll off before I can see them.
  Or if you're a developer, feel free to contribute directly on 
  <a href="https://github.com/JasonSFuller/chaos.thriii.com">Github</a>.
