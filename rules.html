<h1>Rules</h1>

<hr>

<p>
  We only have a few rules, but the most important thing to remember is simply:
  <b>BE NICE!</b>  Everything else can be worked out.
</p>
<p>
  If you accidentally step out of bounds, you may be directed here by one of
  the officers.  Please try not to take it personally.  The officers genuinely
  want to help--and not just you, but the guild as a whole.  If you've been
  given a "warning," don't worry.  It isn't our intention to ridicule or shame
  you, but to foster cooperation and fairness for everyone.  Our long standing
  members understand that people sometimes make mistakes.  That's why we have a
  "3 strikes, you're out" policy, and not "off with his head."
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Be nice!</h3>

<p>
  This is <i>absolutely</i> rule number one, and I cannot emphasize this enough:
  <b>don't be an asshole!</b>  Nothing will get you shutdown faster than being a
  jerk.
</p>

<p>
  And don't be a kiss ass either!  You don't have to agree with everyone.  We
  love <i>and encourage</i> discussion, but...
  <ol>
    <li>Show common courtesy.</li>
    <li>Stay calm.</li>
    <li>Address ideas, not people, <i>i.e.</i> no personal insults!</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h3>Spend 600 energy every day</h3>

<p>
  We expect our members to play regularly by spending at least 600 energy
  every day.  We use this energy to start raids, which benefits everyone. 
  You want General Kenobi shards...?  Raid gear...?  You have to earn your
  keep.
</p>

<h3>Slack and swgoh.gg accounts required</h3>

<p>
  You should talk to us, and we need to be able to reach you.  Communication
  for Territory Battles, Rancor/AAT raids, and just general coordination is 
  important for the health of all the guilds.  Slack keeps us in touch.  Your
  swgoh.gg account helps our leaders plan during Territory Battles.
</p>

<p>
  Did you miss your daily 600?  Tell us what happened!  Sure, this is just a
  game, and yes, we all have busy lives... but as a guild, we need a way to
  weed out the bad apples.  Explaining your side of the story <i>really</i>
  goes a long way with us.  Loose your pants on a Friday night bender...?
  Crazy ex stole all your chargers...?  Drop your phone in the toilet...?
  A hurricane drop a toilet on you...?
</p>

<p>
  We promise to keep an open mind, if you just talk to us.  Otherwise, we have
  to assume the worst.  It'll be a disaster of biblical proportions... total
  chaos... <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087332/quotes/qt0475882">
  human sacrifice... dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria!</a>
</p>

<p>
  We also recognize that the in-game chat leaves a lot to be desired (only a
  limited number of messages saved, no PMs, it's somewhat buggy, <i>etc</i>),
  which is why we use <a href="https://legacyofchaoshome.slack.com/">Slack</a>
  for communication.  You don't have to be plugged in to Slack 24/7, but if we
  mention you (with <code>@username</code>) or send you a PM directly, you
  should respond quickly, as in within 24 hours.  You should be logging in that
  often anyway to complete your daily activities, right?  Right? 
</p>

<p>
  Right.
</p>

<h3>3 strikes and you're out</h3>

<p>
  If you break the rules, you'll be given 2 warnings.  On your 3rd offense,
  you'll be kicked out of the guild.
</p>

<p>
  Don't make us do that.  It upsets Armandz.

  You wouldn't like him when he's angry.</a>

      <a href="https://legacyofchaoshome.slack.com">Slack</a> or
      <a href="mailto:JasonSFuller@gmail.com.">email</a> is the best way to reach
      me, since messages in the guild chat usually roll off before I can see them.
