# Want to help?

If you'd like to contribute to the web site, there are a couple of options.

## If you've never used Github

  1. [Create a Github account](https://github.com/join).
  2. [Join us on Slack](https://legacyofchaoshome.slack.com/).
  3. Post your Github username on #website_of_chaos, and let us know you'd like to contribute.
  4. After getting approval from an officer, we'll add you as a contributor.
  5. You can use Github to update files in the repo directly, no knowledge of `git` 
     required! ...but you **really** should [learn the basics](https://guides.github.com/).

## If you're comfortable with Github

  1. You should try [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) if your `git`-fu isn't super strong.
  2. [Atom](https://atom.io/) is a fantastic editor, plus 
     [it has git integration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FPTUaoHtjQ) after v1.18.
  3. [Play some funky beats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns3SAjqMGU0&index=10&list=PL7-NrfuNPRyyClJ3M_suEWEzIVJWr6HAA), 
     and get to coding.
